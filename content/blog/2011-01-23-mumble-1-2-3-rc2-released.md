This Candidate is pretty much what most of the people using the latest Snapshots have been using the last weeks and we consider it to be very reliable.

As always the download can be found on our webpage at <http://mumble.info>.

If you want to know what exactly was changed since the last RC you can find our commitlog [here][1].

Thanks to all the people that tested RC1 and reported bugs. Without you quite a few release critical bugs would have slipped through. Kudos to you all.
