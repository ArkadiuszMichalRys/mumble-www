Since we had some minor code changes since the last RC we want to give the code a few more days to cool down and **we plan to release Mumble 1.2.3 stable the upcoming weekend**.

We hope you&#8217;ll enjoy our new release. Snapshots/RC users will receive auto updates to stable. Mumble 1.2.2 stable users will see the usual update notification. Of course there willÂ also beÂ another blog entry ðŸ˜‰

Regards,
  
The Mumble Team
