As you might have realised it has been quite some time since 1.2.2Â was released and we are eager to take the next step: 1.2.3 stable.

Unfortunately there is one tricky thing about stable releases:Â They should be stable ğŸ™‚ With now more than [190.000 users][1] using 1.2.2 weÂ cannot risk pushing something out there that breaks what used to work or behaves erratically in otherÂ obvious ways. This is why we needÂ **YOUR HELP**.

In our quest to exterminate each and every bug inÂ Mumble, a quest at least as futile asÂ honorable in software development, we rely on bugreports from you. If you want aÂ quickÂ and stable 1.2.3 release, then get one of our snapshots and test it. If you find a bug please visit our [bugtracker][2] and, unless there already is one, create a ticket. Please remember that for us to be able to fix the bug we will need as much information on it as possible.

Thanks,
  
The Mumble Team
